# 🚀 Maximilian Course Section 5: Page Pre-Rendering & Data Fetching

In Section 5 of Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course, titled **"Page Pre-Rendering & Data Fetching,"** the focus is on understanding how Next.js handles pre-rendering and data fetching. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what this section entails:

## 🌐 Pre-Rendering Techniques
1. **Static Generation (SSG)**
   - Building pages at build time and serving them as static HTML files.
   - Utilizes `getStaticProps` for fetching data at build time.
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - Generating pages on each request, providing up-to-date data.
   - Utilizes `getServerSideProps` for fetching data on each request.

## 🔍 Data Fetching Methods
1. **getStaticProps**
   - Fetches data at build time for static generation.
   - Ideal for pages with static content that doesn't change often.
2. **getServerSideProps**
   - Fetches data on each request for server-side rendering.
   - Suitable for pages that need to display frequently updated data.
3. **getStaticPaths**
   - Dynamically creates paths for static generation based on external data.
   - Used alongside `getStaticProps` for dynamic routing.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice
- Implementing these data fetching methods in a demo project.
- Understanding the benefits and trade-offs of SSG and SSR.
- Learning how to blend server-side and client-side code for optimal performance.

For a comprehensive understanding and practical application, you can follow along with the detailed lectures and coding exercises provided in the course.
